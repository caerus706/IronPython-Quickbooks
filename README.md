# IronPython-Quickbooks

## Requirements
Quickbooks<br>
Quickbooks SDK<br>
IronPython 32bit<br>

### Notes
<b>This will not work with 64-bit Python</b><br>
Tested on IronPython 2.7 (32bit)<br>
Quickbooks and Shell need to be on the same permission level. It won't work if you run python in an admin shell and start Quickbooks normally.
